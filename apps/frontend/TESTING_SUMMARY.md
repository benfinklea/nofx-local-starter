|-------|--------|-------|
| `/#/` | ✅ Working | Dashboard page loads correctly |
| `/#/runs` | ✅ Working | Runs list page accessible |
| `/#/runs/new` | ✅ Working | New run creation page loads |
| `/#/models` | ✅ Working | Models page accessible |
| `/#/projects` | ✅ Working | Projects page loads |
| `/#/settings` | ✅ Working | Settings page accessible |
| `/#/dlq` | ✅ Working | DLQ page loads |
| `/#/builder` | ✅ Working | Builder page accessible |
| `/#/dev` | ✅ Working | Dev links page loads |
| `/#/dev/tools` | ✅ Working | Dev tools page accessible |
| `/#/dev/navigation` | ✅ Working | Navigation console loads |

#### 3. UI Components Verified
- **Login Form**: Email input, password input, submit button
- **Signup Form**: Full name, email, password, create account button
- **Navigation Links**: "Create account" and "Sign in" links work correctly
- **Authentication UI**: All expected elements present and functional

#### 4. Security & Protection
- **Route Protection**: All protected routes require authentication
- **Proper Redirects**: Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- **Form Validation**: Input validation working correctly
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling throughout

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Signup Functionality (Previously Broken)
**Issue**: "Create account" link was not working on the login page.

**Solution**:
- Verified SignupForm component exists and is properly imported
- Confirmed routing configuration includes `/signup` route
- Built and deployed updated frontend to Vercel
- Tested signup form functionality end-to-end

**Result**: ✅ Signup functionality now fully operational

### 2. Navigation Testing Infrastructure
**Created comprehensive test suites**:
- `tests/navigation-links.spec.ts` - Tests all navigation links
- `tests/run-creation.spec.ts` - Tests run creation workflow
- `tests/comprehensive-navigation.spec.ts` - Complete navigation testing
- `tests/signup-workflow.spec.ts` - Authentication workflow testing

## Architecture Verification

### Application Structure
- **Router**: HashRouter for client-side routing (avoiding server config)
- **Authentication**: AuthCheck component protects all routes
- **Shell**: ManifestShell provides navigation drawer and layout
- **Responsive**: Mobile and desktop navigation patterns

### Navigation System
- **Manifest-Driven**: Uses NavigationComposer for dynamic navigation
- **Role-Based**: Supports user roles and permissions
- **Feature Flags**: Conditional navigation based on feature flags
- **Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcut support

## Test Coverage

### Functional Tests
- ✅ Authentication flow (login/signup)
- ✅ Route protection and access control
- ✅ Navigation between all pages
- ✅ Form functionality and validation
- ✅ UI element presence and interaction

### Browser Testing
