## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
Following the user's directive to "steal" code, I:
1. Searched for existing team implementations
2. Found BoardShape's production-tested SQL schema
3. Adapted their RLS policies and table structure
4. Enhanced with NOFX-specific features

### Code Sources
- **BoardShape**: Team invites SQL schema and RLS
- **Next-Supabase-Stripe-Starter**: Suggested structure
- **NOFX Existing**: Email system and middleware patterns
