# Bug Report and Recommendations

## Critical Security Issue Fixed
The system was completely open - anyone could create runs and access all data without authentication. This has been fixed with the SaaS authentication system.

## Implemented Solutions
- Supabase authentication with JWT tokens
- Stripe billing integration
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- API key support for programmatic access
- Rate limiting by subscription tier

## Recommendations
1. Rotate any existing credentials
2. Audit all existing data for unauthorized access
3. Implement monitoring for security events
4. Regular security audits going forward
