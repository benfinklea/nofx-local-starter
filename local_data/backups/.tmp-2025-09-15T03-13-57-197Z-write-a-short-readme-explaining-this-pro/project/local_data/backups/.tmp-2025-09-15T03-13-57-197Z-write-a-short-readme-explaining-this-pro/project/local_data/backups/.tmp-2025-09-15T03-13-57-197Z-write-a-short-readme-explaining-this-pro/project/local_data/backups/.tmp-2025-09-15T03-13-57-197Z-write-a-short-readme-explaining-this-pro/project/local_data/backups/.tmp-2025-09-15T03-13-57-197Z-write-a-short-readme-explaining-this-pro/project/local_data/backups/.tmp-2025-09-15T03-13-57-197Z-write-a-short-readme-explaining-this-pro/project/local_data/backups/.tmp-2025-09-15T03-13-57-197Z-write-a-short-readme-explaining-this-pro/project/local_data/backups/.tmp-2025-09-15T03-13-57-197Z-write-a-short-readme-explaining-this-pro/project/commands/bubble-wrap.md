## Mission Statement

**NEVER BREAK AGAIN PROTOCOL**

This feature works now. We're going to wrap it in so many tests that it becomes virtually unbreakable. Every angle, every edge case, every possible failure mode - covered.

## Scope Determination

Analyzing scope based on command arguments: $ARGUMENTS

{{if contains $ARGUMENTS "--all"}}
**Mode: BULLETPROOF ENTIRE CODEBASE**
Applying comprehensive test coverage to all features and components...
{{else}}
**Mode: BULLETPROOF RECENT CHANGES**
Focusing on recently implemented or modified features. I will:
1. Identify the feature(s) you just got working
2. Analyze all possible failure points
3. Create comprehensive test coverage for bulletproof reliability

To bulletproof the entire codebase, use: `/tests-bulletproof --all`
{{/if}}

## Bulletproofing Strategy

### Phase 1: Feature Analysis & Test Planning

**Feature Mapping**
- Identify all components involved in the feature
- Map data flow from input to output  
- Document all external dependencies
- List all configuration points
- Identify all user interaction paths
- Map all error conditions

**Failure Mode Analysis**
- What could go wrong with user input?
- How could the database fail this?
- What if external services are down?
- What about network failures?
- How could this break under load?
- What if memory/CPU is constrained?
- How could concurrent users break this?
- What about edge cases in data?

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Test Suite Creation

## 1. Unit Tests - Microscopic Protection

**Function-Level Bulletproofing**
- Test every function with valid inputs
- Test with null/undefined/empty values
- Test boundary conditions (min/max values)
- Test with malformed data types
- Test with special characters and Unicode
- Test mathematical edge cases (division by zero, overflow)
- Test with extremely large/small inputs
- Mock all dependencies and test in isolation

```javascript
// Example bulletproof unit test structure
describe('CriticalFeature', () => {
  describe('input validation', () => {
    test.each([
      [null, 'handles null input'],
      [undefined, 'handles undefined input'],
      ['', 'handles empty string'],
      [0, 'handles zero value'],
      [-1, 'handles negative numbers'],
      [Number.MAX_VALUE, 'handles maximum values'],
      ['<script>alert("xss")</script>', 'sanitizes malicious input'],
      ['üöÄüéâüí•', 'handles emoji and special unicode'],
      [' '.repeat(1000000), 'handles extremely long strings']
    ])('with %p input: %s', async (input, description) => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
