Step 9

- Control plane: Initialize and start master services (API server, controller-manager, scheduler, etcd); secure endpoints and backups.
- Verification: Confirm control plane health and connectivity (e.g., component status, API response, kube-system pods) before proceeding.
- Workers: Join worker nodes using the join token/command, verify nodes reach Ready, then apply required labels/taints and workloads.
