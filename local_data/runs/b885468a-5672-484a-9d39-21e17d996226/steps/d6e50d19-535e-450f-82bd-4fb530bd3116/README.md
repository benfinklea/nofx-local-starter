Step 57

- Control plane: Apply configuration and updates to master nodes (API server, controller-manager, scheduler); ensure etcd healthy and components restarted if needed.
- Verification: Confirm control plane health and cluster status (API responsiveness, etcd quorum, kube-system pods, node readiness); run smoke tests.
- Workers: Join or update worker nodes, verify kubelet + kube-proxy running, ensure labels/taints and networking are correct; run workload validation.
