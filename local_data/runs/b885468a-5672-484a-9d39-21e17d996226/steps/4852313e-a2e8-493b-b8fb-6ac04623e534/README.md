Step 82

- Control plane: Ensure API servers, controllers, and schedulers are deployed and healthy; apply configuration changes and restart components as needed.
- Verification: Run health checks and smoke tests (API endpoints, etcd quorum, controller metrics); confirm no errors in logs.
- Workers: Update node configurations, drain and cordon nodes if required, restart kubelet/services, and rejoin nodes; verify workload readiness.
