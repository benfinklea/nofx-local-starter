- Control plane — Central orchestration layer: exposes APIs, stores configuration, schedules work, enforces policies, and coordinates lifecycle and scaling.
- Verification — Validation and assurance layer: runs unit/integration checks, policy and security validations, and continuous verification to ensure desired state and correctness.
- Workers — Execution layer: lightweight agents that pull tasks from the control plane, run workloads, report status/metrics, and handle retries and local resource management.
