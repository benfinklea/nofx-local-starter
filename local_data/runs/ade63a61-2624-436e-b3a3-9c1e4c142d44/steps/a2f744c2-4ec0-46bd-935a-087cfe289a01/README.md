Step 3

- Control plane — deploy and secure core services (API server, controllers, scheduler, datastore); enable HA and backups.
- Verification — run health checks and logs, validate endpoints, certificates, and component status before proceeding.
- Workers — join worker nodes, verify kubelet/networking, and run a test workload to confirm scheduling and connectivity.
