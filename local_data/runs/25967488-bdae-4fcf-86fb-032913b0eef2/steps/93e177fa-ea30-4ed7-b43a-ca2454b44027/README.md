Test 3

- Control plane — deploy and verify core services (API, controllers, scheduler); confirm leader election and API responsiveness.
- Verification — run automated health checks and smoke tests; collect logs and metrics to assert readiness.
- Workers — bring up worker nodes, ensure kubelet/agent registration, and validate workload scheduling and resource utilization.
