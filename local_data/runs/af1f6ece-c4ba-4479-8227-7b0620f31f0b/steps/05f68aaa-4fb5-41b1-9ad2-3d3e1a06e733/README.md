Test 4

- Control plane: Verify control-plane components are running and responsive (API server, controller-manager, scheduler).
- Verification: Run automated health and smoke checks; fail on critical errors or unmet assertions.
- Workers: Ensure worker nodes join, run workloads, and pass node-level networking/storage/kubelet checks.
