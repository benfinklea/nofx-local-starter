Step 79

- Control plane: Ensure API server, controller-manager, scheduler and etcd are healthy and reachable; confirm certificates and RBAC are valid.
- Verification: Run quick checks (kubectl get nodes,pods; etcdctl endpoint health; component logs) and confirm cluster health indicators are green.
- Workers: Verify kubelets are registered, CNI networking is functional, and workloads schedule/run correctly; restart or reprovision any failing nodes.
