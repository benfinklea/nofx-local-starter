- Control plane: Initialize and start control-plane components (API server, controller-manager, scheduler); ensure etcd is healthy and certificates are loaded.
- Verification: Run health checks (API reachable, controller/scheduler healthy), validate cluster objects, confirm networking and DNS resolution.
- Workers: Join worker nodes to the cluster, verify kubelet status, remove bootstrap taints, and confirm pods schedule and run correctly.
