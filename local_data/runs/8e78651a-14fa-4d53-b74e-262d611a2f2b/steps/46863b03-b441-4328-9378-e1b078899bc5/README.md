Step 53

- Control plane: Ensure control-plane components (etcd, kube-apiserver, controller-manager, scheduler) are healthy and quorum is intact; check service logs and restart failing pods.
- Verification: Run quick health checks (kubectl get nodes,pods -A; curl API health endpoints), deploy a smoke app, and confirm networking/DNS.
- Workers: Confirm kubelet and kube-proxy are running, nodes are Ready, apply necessary labels/taints, and join or reprovision any failed worker nodes.
