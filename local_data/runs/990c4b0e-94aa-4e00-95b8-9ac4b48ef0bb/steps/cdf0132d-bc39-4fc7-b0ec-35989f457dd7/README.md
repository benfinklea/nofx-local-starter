- Control plane — central coordinator: exposes API/CLI for config and rollouts, schedules tasks, manages auth/leadership, stores global state and health/metrics.
- Verification — validators and checks: runs pre/post-deploy tests, policy and signature verification, reports pass/fail to control plane for gating actions.
- Workers — execution agents: pull tasks from queue, run jobs/processing, stream logs/metrics, perform retries and report results back to the control plane.
