NOFX README (design 5)

- Components
  - API Gateway: single-entry REST/gRPC endpoint, auth, rate limiting.
  - Ingest Service: validates/normalizes incoming events, enqueues to Broker.
  - Broker: durable message queue (Kafka/Rabbit) for decoupling.
  - Processor Workers: stateless workers for transformation, enrichment, side-effects.
  - Storage: OLTP store for metadata, OLAP store for analytics, object store for blobs.
  - Orchestration/Config: service discovery, feature flags, schema registry.
  - Monitoring & Alerting: logs, metrics, tracing, health checks.

- Data Flow
  - Client -> API Gateway -> Ingest Service (validate/normalize).
  - Ingest -> Broker (produce event).
  - Processor Workers consume from Broker -> transform/enrich -> write to Storage and/or emit downstream events.
  - Downstream consumers (analytics, reporting, third-party integrations) read from OLAP or Broker.
  - Observability feeds metrics/traces to monitoring stack.

- Constraints
  - Throughput: must handle high event rates (tens of thousands/sec).
  - Latency: sub-second end-to-end for critical paths; batch processing allowed for analytics.
  - Durability: at-least-once delivery with replayability (retention window).
  - Schema evolution: backward/forward compatibility required.
