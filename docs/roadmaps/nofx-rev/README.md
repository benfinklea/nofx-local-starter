# üöÄ NOFX Control Plane REV ‚Äî Revised Roadmap Documentation

> **Roadmap for maturing the control plane, building stepwise on the current cloud foundation**

This directory contains the **revised NOFX Control Plane roadmap**. The goal is to evolve the starter project into a durable orchestration platform by layering new capabilities on top of the services we already operate (Vercel-hosted API, Supabase persistence, Stripe billing, shared worker runtime). Each phase assumes the previous one is complete and hardened before we move forward.

---

## üìã Executive Summary

### Current State Assessment

The NOFX Control Plane today offers a **production-aligned foundation** that we actively evolve:

- ‚úÖ **Cloud Footprint**: Vercel front/back ends plus Supabase Postgres (runs, steps, queue state)
- ‚úÖ **Auth & Billing Primitives**: Admin sessions, Stripe subscription scaffolding, usage tracking
- ‚úÖ **Observability Hooks**: Structured logging, correlation IDs, experimental tracing
- ‚úÖ **Queue & Worker**: BullMQ-compatible adapters (Redis, Postgres) with idempotent step execution
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Templates & Registry**: Early design docs and plan builder hooks, implementation scheduled for Phase‚ÄØ1
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Reliability Work**: Disaster recovery, compliance evidence, and runbook maturity still in-flight

### Roadmap Philosophy

The revised roadmap focuses on **incremental maturation**:

1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Extend, rather than replace, the current services and tooling
2. **Parallel Agent Execution**: When capacity allows, run three coordinated tracks with tight integration checkpoints
3. **Incremental Enhancement**: Land foundational capabilities (registry, orchestration) before tackling autonomy and AI
4. **Enterprise Focus**: Treat compliance, reliability, and auditability as non-negotiable quality bars

---

## üéØ Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Agent Registry & Template Enhancement (Current Priority)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Status**: Ready to Execute
**Focus**: Finish the Supabase-backed agent registry and launch the first version of the template catalogue.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Agent registry infrastructure with full CRUD operations
- Enhanced template marketplace foundation
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for both registries
- Integration with existing enterprise infrastructure

### Phase 2: Advanced Orchestration & Intelligence
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks | **Status**: Planned
**Focus**: Layer orchestration patterns and workflow intelligence on top of the Phase‚ÄØ1 registry + telemetry.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Multi-agent orchestration engine (solo, pair, hierarchical, swarm patterns)
- Intelligent workflow automation with AI-powered optimization
- Predictive operations and analytics for business intelligence

### Phase 3: Enterprise Integration & Ecosystem Expansion
**Duration**: 4-5 weeks | **Status**: Strategic
**Focus**: Expand integrations and marketplace features once orchestration/data pipelines are stable.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Enterprise system connectors (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira, etc.)
- Extension marketplace with developer ecosystem
- Global operations with multi-region deployment and advanced security

## ü§ñ Parallel Agent Execution Strategy

### Core Concept

Each phase is designed for **up to 3 concurrent agents** working on coordinated tracks:

- **ü§ñ Agent Alpha** ‚Üí Primary infrastructure and core systems
- **ü§ñ Agent Beta** ‚Üí Secondary features and enhancements
- **ü§ñ Agent Gamma** ‚Üí Integration, testing, and DevOps

### Benefits of Parallel Execution

1. **Higher Throughput**: Concurrent work when we have capacity and clear interfaces
2. **Specialized Focus**: Each agent goes deep on their domain while staying aligned via shared contracts
3. **Reduced Blockers**: Pre-agreed dependencies and sequencing avoid stepping on each other
4. **Quality Ownership**: Dedicated integration/test track catches drift before it hits mainline

### Coordination Mechanisms

- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute sync on progress and blockers
- **Weekly Reviews**: Shared demo + integration plan for the week ahead
- **Contract Freezes**: API/schema contracts versioned before sprint mid-point
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing plus nightly integration branch dry-runs
- **Shared Documentation**: Update runbooks and ADRs as changes land
