## Track A ‚Äî Multi-Agent Orchestration Engine
**Owner: Agent Alpha**
**Estimated: 3-4 weeks | Priority: High**

### Core Orchestration Framework
- **Agent Coordination Service**:
  - Dynamic agent selection from registry based on capabilities and performance
  - Real-time agent load balancing and resource allocation
  - Inter-agent communication protocols with message queuing
  - Hierarchical agent relationships (supervisor/worker patterns)

### Orchestration Patterns
- **Strategy Implementation**:
  - **Solo Mode**: Single agent execution with enhanced capabilities
  - **Pair Mode**: Two agents with complementary skills (e.g., coder + reviewer)
  - **Hierarchical Mode**: Supervisor agent directing multiple worker agents
  - **Swarm Mode**: Collaborative agent clusters for complex problems

### Dynamic Agent Marketplace
- **Capability-Based Selection**:
  ```typescript
  interface AgentCapability {
    skillId: string;
    proficiencyLevel: number;
    resourceRequirements: ResourceProfile;
    averageLatency: number;
    successRate: number;
    costPerOperation: number;
  }
  ```

- **Smart Routing Engine**:
  - Analyze task requirements and match optimal agent combinations
  - Consider cost, latency, success rate, and resource availability
  - Implement circuit breakers for underperforming agents
  - Auto-scaling based on demand and performance metrics

### Coordination Infrastructure
- **Agent Communication Hub**:
  - Extend existing event bus for inter-agent messaging
  - Implement message persistence and replay capabilities
  - Add agent-to-agent direct communication channels
  - Context sharing and handoff protocols
