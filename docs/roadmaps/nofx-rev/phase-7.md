# 🧠 NOFX Control Plane REV · Phase 7 — Consciousness-Aware Systems & AGI Preparation

> **Goal**: Prepare the platform for artificial general intelligence (AGI) with consciousness-aware systems, advanced ethical frameworks, and comprehensive safety measures. Execute with 3 parallel agents for responsible AGI development.

> **Context**: Building on quantum and edge computing capabilities to create the foundation for AGI systems with self-awareness, ethical reasoning, and robust safety controls.

## 🎯 Parallel Agent Execution Strategy

This phase is designed for **3 concurrent agents** working on AGI foundations:

- **🤖 Agent Alpha** → Track A (Meta-Learning & Self-Awareness)
- **🤖 Agent Beta** → Track B (Ethical AI & Governance)
- **🤖 Agent Gamma** → Track C (AGI Safety & Control Systems)

Each track builds essential components for responsible AGI development.

### Dependencies
- Phase 6 hybrid intelligence stack operational with documented guardrails
- Ethics, legal, and governance forums chartered with clear escalation paths
- Data provenance + consent records maintained for all training corpora
- Safety engineering team staffed with mandate to co-own design and verification

### Milestone Gate
Only continue beyond Phase 7 when the following are independently verified:
- Meta-learning systems meeting agreed self-awareness benchmarks without policy violations
- Ethical governance framework audited by external reviewers, with remediation closed
- Safety/containment drills executed successfully, including emergency shutdown and rollback
- Regulatory and stakeholder approvals explicitly recorded for any AGI-adjacent deployment
