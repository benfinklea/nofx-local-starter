# 🌐 NOFX Control Plane REV · Phase 3 — Enterprise Integration & Ecosystem Expansion

> **Goal**: Transform the intelligent orchestration platform into a comprehensive enterprise ecosystem with third-party integrations, marketplace capabilities, and global deployment architecture. Execute with 3 parallel agents for comprehensive ecosystem development.

> **Context**: Building on the intelligent orchestration capabilities to create an enterprise-grade platform that integrates seamlessly with existing enterprise infrastructure and supports a rich ecosystem of extensions.

---

## 🎯 Parallel Agent Execution Strategy

This phase is designed for **3 concurrent agents** working on ecosystem expansion:

- **🤖 Agent Alpha** → Track A (Enterprise Integration Platform)
- **🤖 Agent Beta** → Track B (Marketplace & Extension Ecosystem)
- **🤖 Agent Gamma** → Track C (Global Operations & Security Framework)

Each track builds complementary ecosystem capabilities for complete enterprise integration.

### Dependencies
- Phase 2 orchestration + analytics services stable and emitting audit-friendly events
- Design system + API contracts finalized for registry/marketplace exposure
- Legal/finance alignment in place for marketplace monetization experiments
- Security baseline (threat model, pen-test findings) documented for integrations to build upon

### Milestone Gate
Move to Phase 4 after delivering and validating:
- At least two enterprise connectors (e.g., Jira, Slack) live in pilot accounts with SLA metrics tracked
- Marketplace MVP launched with developer onboarding flow and billing smoke tests
- Global operations playbooks drafted (incident response, failover) and dry-run executed
- Independent security review covering new integrations and marketplace surface area
