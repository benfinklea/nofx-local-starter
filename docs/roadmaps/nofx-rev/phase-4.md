# 🔮 NOFX Control Plane REV · Phase 4 — Autonomous Operations & Self-Healing

> **Goal**: Transform the platform into a self-managing, self-healing system with autonomous decision-making capabilities, predictive maintenance, and automated problem resolution. Execute with 3 parallel agents for comprehensive autonomy.

> **Context**: Building on the intelligent orchestration and enterprise integration to create truly autonomous operations that minimize human intervention while maintaining enterprise control.

## 🎯 Parallel Agent Execution Strategy

This phase is designed for **3 concurrent agents** working on autonomous capabilities:

- **🤖 Agent Alpha** → Track A (Autonomous Decision Engine)
- **🤖 Agent Beta** → Track B (Self-Healing Infrastructure)
- **🤖 Agent Gamma** → Track C (Predictive Maintenance & Optimization)

Each track builds complementary autonomous capabilities for complete operational independence.

### Dependencies
- Phase 3 enterprise connectors + marketplace telemetry feeding into shared data lake
- Global operations monitoring stack emitting high-fidelity metrics/logs
- Security and compliance controls updated to cover automation hooks
- Runbooks + SLOs defined for core services (inputs to risk scoring)

### Milestone Gate
Graduate to Phase 5 once we can demonstrate:
- Autonomous decision engine running in “assist mode” with human-in-the-loop overrides logged
- Self-healing workflows resolving an agreed subset of incidents in staging with rollback paths tested
- Predictive maintenance models outperforming manual forecasts on pilot services
- Governance review approving expansion to fully automated actions in production
