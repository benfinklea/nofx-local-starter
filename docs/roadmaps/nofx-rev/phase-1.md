# ðŸš€ NOFX Control Plane REV Â· Phase 1 â€” Agent Registry & Template Enhancement

> **Goal**: Complete the cloud-native agent registry system while enhancing the already sophisticated template management infrastructure. Execute with 3 parallel agents to maximize development velocity.

> **Context**: Building on the enterprise-grade foundation already implemented (observability, auth, billing, queue system) to complete the missing registry components.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Parallel Agent Execution Strategy

This phase is designed for **3 concurrent agents** working independently on separate tracks:

- **ðŸ¤– Agent Alpha** â†’ Track A (Agent Registry Infrastructure)
- **ðŸ¤– Agent Beta** â†’ Track B (Template System Enhancement)
- **ðŸ¤– Agent Gamma** â†’ Track C (Integration & DevOps Pipeline)

Each track has minimal dependencies to enable true parallel execution.

### Dependencies
- Shared Supabase project provisioned with baseline schemas (`runs`, `steps`, queue tables)
- Existing plan builder hooks ready to consume registry/template data
- Observability stack from current production (logging, correlation IDs) accessible to all tracks
- Stripe sandbox keys configured for integration smoke tests

### Milestone Gate
Proceed to Phaseâ€¯2 only when the following are complete and reviewed:
- Agent registry + template schemas migrated and protected with RLS
- Core `/api/agents/*` and template endpoints deployed with >90â€¯% changed-line coverage
- Registry CLI/CI tooling exercised in at least one dry-run publish cycle
- Runbooks updated to cover registry deployment, rollback, and on-call diagnostics

---

## Track A â€” Agent Registry Infrastructure
**Owner: Agent Alpha**
**Estimated: 2-3 weeks | Priority: High**

### Core Implementation
- Implement `/api/agents/` Vercel Functions:
  - `api/agents/index.ts` - List agents with filtering/pagination
  - `api/agents/[id]/index.ts` - Get specific agent details
  - `api/agents/[id]/rollback.ts` - Rollback to previous version
  - `api/agents/publish.ts` - Publish new agent with validation
  - `api/agents/validate.ts` - Validate agent manifest

### Database Schema Extensions
- Extend `nofx` schema with new tables:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE agent_registry (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    current_version TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('active', 'deprecated', 'disabled')),
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );

  CREATE TABLE agent_versions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    agent_registry_id UUID REFERENCES agent_registry(id),
    version TEXT NOT NULL,
    manifest JSONB NOT NULL,
    commit_sha TEXT,
    published_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('active', 'draft', 'archived'))
  );
  ```

### Registry Scripts
- Create `scripts/registry/` directory with TypeScript utilities:
  - `publishAgents.ts` - Upload agents with commit metadata
  - `validateAgents.ts` - Validate agent manifests with Zod
  - `syncRegistry.ts` - Sync local definitions to cloud

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing idempotency middleware for publish operations
- Use existing correlation tracking for registry operations

- Utilize existing auth system for registry access control

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/agentRegistry.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/agentRegistryApi.test.ts`
