## üíé **THE GOAL: PRODUCT-MARKET FIT SIGNALS**

We're looking for these magic words from construction professionals:
- *"This would save us hours every week"*
- *"We lose so much time on coordination"*
- *"Our current tools don't talk to each other"*
- *"Regulatory compliance is a nightmare"*
- *"When can we see a demo?"*
- *"We'd pay for this right now"*
- *"You need to talk to [other person] about this"*

**When you hear frustration about project coordination, document management, and regulatory compliance paired with budget authority and willingness to pay ‚Üí you've found product-market fit.**

**Time to turn those insights into ConstructBot MVP!** üèóÔ∏èü§ñ‚ú®

## üèóÔ∏è **CONSTRUCTBOT POSITIONING PREVIEW**

**Tagline**: *"The AI project partner that handles everything except the actual construction."*

**Value Proposition**: *"ConstructBot automates project coordination, document management, and regulatory compliance so architects and contractors can focus on building great projects, not managing administrative chaos."*

**Target Customer**: Mid-market architecture firms ($5M-$50M) and general contractors ($10M-$100M) who are drowning in project coordination complexity but can't afford enterprise solutions.

This interview plan will validate whether the construction market truly offers the high-value, complex workflow automation opportunity our analysis suggests, and give us the insights needed to build a construction-specific AI automation platform that commands $50K-$200K annual contracts.
