# NOFX Bootstrap Plan: Building the Builder
*6 Sprints to Self-Building Capability*

## üß† The Meta-Strategy

**Core Insight**: Instead of manually building Business OS, first complete NOFX so it can orchestrate complex development projects - including building itself!

**Goal**: Get NOFX to the state where you can say:
> "Build a Business OS with narrative interface that lets entrepreneurs automate workflows through storytelling"

And NOFX will:
1. Decompose this into 50+ parallel tasks
2. Spawn multiple AI agents to work simultaneously
3. Coordinate code generation, testing, and integration
4. Handle git workflows and deployment
5. Self-improve its own capabilities
