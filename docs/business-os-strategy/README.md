- **Phase 3** (Months 5-6): Narrative OS interface
- **Phase 4** (Month 7+): Customer-driven features

## üéØ Key Principles

- **Layered Architecture**: Keep NOFX lean, build business abstractions separately
- **Story-First Interface**: Natural language makes automation accessible
- **Character-Based Functions**: Business roles as personalities with traits
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple stories can become arbitrarily complex
- **Customer Validation**: Build incrementally based on real user needs

## üè¢ The Vision

Transform NOFX from a workflow engine into a complete Business Operating System where entrepreneurs can describe their processes as stories with characters, making sophisticated automation accessible to anyone who can write.

**The result**: A platform where "Every morning, Sales Scout checks for leads..." becomes a fully automated business process with real-time execution, personality-driven behavior, and comprehensive business intelligence.
