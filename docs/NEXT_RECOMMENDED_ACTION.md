## 🎯 Top Recommendation: Quick Wins Week

**Effort**: ~1 week
**Value**: HIGH
**Impact**: Immediate user experience improvements

### Why This First?

After completing a major migration, it's smart to knock out several quick wins to:
1. **Build momentum** with visible progress
2. **Improve user experience** with finishing touches
3. **Clear technical debt** before new features
4. **Give yourself a break** from complex work

### The Plan (5 Tasks, ~1 Week Total)

```
Day 1-2: Complete Minor Email Features (6-9 hours total)
  ├─ Wire Password Reset Email (2-4 hours)
  │  └─ Template exists, just needs Supabase auth integration
  │
  ├─ Build Usage Limit Warning Email (2-3 hours)
  │  └─ Create template + threshold detection
  │
  └─ Automate Stripe Fixtures (4-6 hours)
     └─ Script to auto-create products/prices/webhooks

Day 3-4: Build Team Management UI (1-2 days)
  └─ Backend API is 100% complete, just needs frontend
     ├─ Teams page
     ├─ Team switcher component
     ├─ Member management interface
     └─ Invite flow UI

Day 5: Test & Polish
  └─ Integration testing
  └─ User acceptance testing
  └─ Documentation updates
```

### Expected Outcomes

By end of week:
- ✅ Complete password reset flow (better UX)
- ✅ Proactive usage warnings (prevent issues)
- ✅ Automated Stripe setup (faster onboarding)
- ✅ Self-service team management (huge value for users)
- ✅ All minor gaps from 14-day plan closed

### Risk: LOW

## 🥉 Alternative Option 2: Fix TypeScript Errors

**Effort**: 1-3 days
**Value**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Developer experience

### The Problem

Pre-existing TypeScript errors prevent:

  └─ List all TS errors by file and severity

Day 2-3: Fix Systematically
  ├─ Fix high-impact files first
  ├─ Add proper types
  └─ Remove 'as unknown' casts
```

### Expected Outcomes

- ✅ Clean TypeScript build
- ✅ Test coverage working
