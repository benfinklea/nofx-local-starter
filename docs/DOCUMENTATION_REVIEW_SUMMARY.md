### 📦 Archived Documentation

The following files were **archived** to `Docs/archive/` due to obsolescence:

#### Migration Documentation (5 files → archived)
**Location:** `Docs/archive/migration/`

- `CLOUD_MIGRATION.md`
- `MIGRATION_STATUS.md`
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `API_MIGRATION_README.md`
- `CLOUD_MIGRATION_TESTS.md`

**Reason:** Cloud migration completed September 26, 2025. These docs describe the migration process, which is now historical.

**Replacement:** Created `Docs/migration/README.md` explaining completion and pointing to current deployment docs.

#### Outdated Technical Documentation (2 files → archived)
**Location:** `Docs/archive/`

1. **`TROUBLESHOOTING_OLD.md`** (formerly `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
   - **Issues:** Extensive Docker/Redis references (no longer used in production)
   - **Issues:** Local-only troubleshooting (doesn't cover Vercel/Supabase)
   - **Issues:** No Agent SDK troubleshooting guidance
   - **Replacement:** Complete rewrite reflecting cloud architecture

2. **`REFACTORING_PLAN_OLD.md`** (formerly `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`)
   - **Issues:** References 582-line `store.ts` file (may have been refactored)
   - **Issues:** Plans from before cloud migration
   - **Issues:** Doesn't reflect current Agent SDK architecture
   - **Reason:** Historical document; refactoring may have occurred or priorities shifted

        │ • Storage    │
        │ • Auth       │
        └──────────────┘
```

### Key Technology Decisions
- ✅ **No Redis in production** - PostgreSQL-based queue
- ✅ **No Docker in production** - Serverless Vercel Functions
- ✅ **Supabase for all data** - Database, queue, storage, auth
- ✅ **Agent SDK for AI** - `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.1.0`
- ✅ **Modern Auth** - `@supabase/ssr` package

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Complete)
- ✅ Archive outdated migration documentation
- ✅ Replace TROUBLESHOOTING.md with cloud-focused version
- ✅ Archive outdated REFACTORING_PLAN.md
- ✅ Create migration completion notice

### Short-Term Actions (Recommended)
1. **Review "Future feature ideas.md"**
   - Remove completed ideas (Agent SDK, cloud migration)
   - Update with current feature backlog
   - Archive if no longer relevant

2. **Review "Testing instructions.md"**
   - Verify test commands match `package.json`
   - Update test file paths to reflect centralized `tests/` directory
   - Add Agent SDK testing instructions

3. **Verify Control Plane API Documentation**
   - Check `Docs/control-plane/openapi.yaml` against current endpoints
   - Update `API_REFERENCE.md` if needed

### Long-Term Maintenance
1. **Establish Documentation Review Process**
   - Quarterly review of all documentation
   - Update as architectural changes occur
   - Archive outdated planning documents promptly

2. **Keep AI_CODER_GUIDE.md as Source of Truth**
   - All other documentation should reference it
   - Update it first when architecture changes
   - Use it to validate other documentation currency

3. **Document Completion of Phases**
   - When Phase 1 completes, create completion summary (like AGENT_SDK_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md)
   - Archive planning docs, keep completion summaries
   - This creates clear historical record
