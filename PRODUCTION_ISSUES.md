## Issue #1: Authentication Session Errors on Initial Load (CRITICAL)

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Blocking optimal user experience
**Discovered in:** Test #6 - Console errors check

### Description
Console shows authentication session missing errors immediately after page load, even when user attempts to log in.

### Error Messages
```
Get current user error: AuthSessionMissingError: Auth session missing!
    at https://nofx-local-starter-rimaqj2mq-volacci.vercel.app/assets/index-CFtNtRD6.js:314:9235
    at zN._useSession (https://nofx-local-starter-rimaqj2mq-volacci.vercel.app/assets/index-CFtNtRD6.js:314:7221)
    at async zN._getUser (https://nofx-local-starter-rimaqj2mq-volacci.vercel.app/assets/index-CFtNtRD6.js:314:9034)
```

### Impact
- Causes 401 errors on protected endpoints
- May cause session management issues
- Creates unnecessary error noise in logs
- Could indicate race condition in auth initialization

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to production URL
2. Open browser console
3. Fill in login credentials
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Observe console errors immediately

### Evidence
- Screenshot: `prod-test-6-errors.png`

## Issue #3: Missing "Teams" and "Dashboard" Navigation Links (HIGH)

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** Feature incomplete or hidden
**Discovered in:** Test #7 - Navigation links test

### Description
After successful login, the "Teams" and "Dashboard" navigation links are not visible in the UI, despite being expected core features.

### Test Results
```
Testing navigation links...
  Runs link: ✅
  Teams link: ❌ Not found
  Settings link: ✅
  Dashboard link: ❌ Not found
```

### Impact
- Users cannot access Teams functionality
- Users cannot access Dashboard view
- Core features appear to be missing or inaccessible
- Reduces application usability

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Wait for runs page to load
3. Look for "Teams" link in navigation - NOT FOUND
4. Look for "Dashboard" link in navigation - NOT FOUND

### Evidence
- Screenshot: `prod-test-7-navigation.png`
- Screenshot: `prod-test-8a-logged-in.png`
- Console output from navigation test

### Suggested Fix
- Verify if Teams and Dashboard features are implemented
- Check if navigation links are conditionally rendered based on permissions/roles
- Ensure routing configuration includes these paths
- Add navigation items to the header/sidebar component

## Issue #4: Missing Semantic HTML Elements (HIGH)

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** Accessibility and SEO concern
**Discovered in:** Test #10 - Blank screen check

### Description
The application is missing proper semantic HTML structure. No `<nav>` or `<main>` elements detected after login.

### Test Results
```
Has header: ✅
Has nav: ❌ Not found
Has main: ❌ Not found
```

### Impact
- Poor accessibility for screen readers
- Reduced SEO value
- Does not follow HTML5 best practices
- May impact keyboard navigation

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in successfully
2. Inspect page structure with DevTools
3. Search for `<nav>` element - NOT FOUND
4. Search for `<main>` element - NOT FOUND

### Evidence
- Screenshot: `prod-test-10-blank-screen-check.png`
- Console output showing missing elements

### Suggested Fix
- Wrap navigation elements in `<nav>` tag
- Wrap main content area in `<main>` tag
- Update React components to use semantic HTML
- Run accessibility audit to find other issues

## Issue #5: Google OAuth Redirect Configuration (MEDIUM)

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** OAuth configuration needs verification
**Discovered in:** Test #9 - Google OAuth button test

### Description
Google OAuth button redirects to Google sign-in, but the OAuth flow may have incorrect redirect URLs configured.

### Observed Behavior
```
URL after Google button click: https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?opparams=%253Fredirect_to%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fnofx-local-starter-rimaqj2mq-volacci.vercel.app%25252Fauth%25252Fcallback...
```

The redirect URL points to the specific deployment URL rather than the canonical domain, which could cause issues:
- `redirect_to=https://nofx-local-starter-rimaqj2mq-volacci.vercel.app/auth/callback`

### Impact
- OAuth flow may break if deployment URL changes
- Users may not complete OAuth successfully
- Could cause redirect mismatch errors

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to login page
2. Click "Sign in with Google" button
3. Observe redirect URL contains deployment-specific URL

### Evidence
- Screenshot: `prod-test-9-google-oauth.png`
- Console log showing full OAuth redirect URL

### Suggested Fix
- Configure OAuth redirect URL to use canonical domain (e.g., nofx-control-plane.vercel.app)
- Update Supabase project settings to whitelist both domains
- Update Google Cloud Console OAuth settings
- Use environment variable for redirect URL instead of hardcoding

## Issue #6: Password Reset Flow Not Fully Tested (MEDIUM)

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** Partial functionality verified
**Discovered in:** Test #3 - Password reset form test

### Description
Password reset form is accessible and accepts email input, but full flow (email sending, reset link, new password) was not tested end-to-end.

### Observed Behavior
- "Forgot password?" button is visible and clickable ✅
- Email field accepts input ✅
- Form displays correctly ✅
- Email actually sent - NOT VERIFIED
- Reset link works - NOT VERIFIED
- Password update works - NOT VERIFIED

### Impact
- Users may not be able to reset passwords if flow is broken
- Could lead to locked out users
- Support burden increases

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to login page
2. Click "Forgot password?" link
3. Enter email address
4. (Full flow not tested)

### Evidence
- Screenshot: `prod-test-3-forgot-password.png`
- Screenshot: `prod-test-3b-forgot-password-filled.png`

### Suggested Fix
- Implement automated test for complete password reset flow
- Verify email is sent via Supabase
- Test reset link expiration
- Add user feedback for successful password reset request

## Issue #7: Login Redirect May Show Brief Flash (LOW)

**Severity:** LOW
**Status:** UX polish needed
**Discovered in:** Test #4 - Login with valid credentials

### Description
After successful login, there appears to be a 3-5 second delay before content fully loads, during which the page may show partial content or loading state.

### Observed Behavior
- Login click is successful
- Redirect to `/#/runs` occurs
- Content eventually loads correctly
- No blank screen, but noticeable delay

### Impact
- Minor UX concern
- Users may think app is slow or broken
- Could be improved with better loading indicators

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Enter valid credentials
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Observe delay before content appears
4. Page eventually loads with runs data

### Evidence
- Screenshots: `prod-test-4a-before-login.png`, `prod-test-4b-after-login-click.png`, `prod-test-4c-final-state.png`
- 3-5 second wait time observed

### Suggested Fix
- Add loading spinner during authentication
- Preload critical data during auth
- Use optimistic UI updates
- Add skeleton screens for better perceived performance
