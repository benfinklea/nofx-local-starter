## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Resend Integration** ✅
- Installed Resend SDK and React Email dependencies
- Created reusable email client with retry logic
- Configured environment variables for email settings

### 2. **Email Infrastructure** ✅
Created modular email system:
- `/src/lib/email/resend-client.ts` - Core email client with retry logic
- `/src/config/email.ts` - Centralized email configuration
- `/src/services/email/emailService.ts` - High-level email service functions

### 3. **Email Templates** ✅
Built React Email templates:
- `BaseEmailTemplate.tsx` - Reusable base template with consistent styling
- `WelcomeEmail.tsx` - New user welcome email
- `SubscriptionConfirmationEmail.tsx` - Subscription activation confirmation
- `PaymentFailedEmail.tsx` - Payment failure notification

### 4. **Email Triggers** ✅
Integrated email sending into key flows:
- **Signup Flow**: Welcome email sent on new user registration
- **Subscription Created**: Confirmation email when subscription activated
- **Payment Failed**: Alert email when payment fails
